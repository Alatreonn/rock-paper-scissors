Assignment from https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

## Summary
The standard Rock Paper Scissors experience on your screen! Play against the algorithm until either of you reach 5 wins. UI was made with bigger screen in mind but it should work on any phone or tablet.

## How to play
1. Click [here](https://alatreonn.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) to open the page that hosts the game.
2. While knowing the counters and weaknesses of each (Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock), try to predict what the algorithm has already chosen by clicking on one of the three buttons (33.3% chance, no cheating implemented!).
3. The game will be concluded when one side has 5 wins in total. After a short pause you can start a new round by once again clicking on any button.

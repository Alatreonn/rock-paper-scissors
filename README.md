## Summary
The standard Rock Paper Scissors experience on your screen! Play against the algorithm until either of you reach 5 wins. UI was made with bigger screen in mind but it should work on any phone or tablet.

## How to play
1. While knowing the counters and weaknesses of each (Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock), try to predict what the algorithm has already chosen by clicking on one of the three buttons (33.3% chance, no cheating implemented!).
2. The game will be concluded when one side has 5 wins in total.
3. After a short pause you can start a new round by once again clicking on any button.
